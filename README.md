# Flappy-Bird-Game-Python-Pygame
This is a custom Flappy Bird clone built using Python and the Pygame library. The project includes multiple skins, dynamic maps, a persistent save system, and a responsive GUI interface. It was developed as a university project and expanded for additional features and polish.
